# SVM-Image-Classification
This Machine learning Image classification uses scikit-learn SVM image classification algorithm. It classifies image into three categories:  Cars, Ice cream cone and Cricket ball with an accuracy of 90%. This project explores the performance of SVM in image classification. We can upload an image to predict its class/category using this project.
